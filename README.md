# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

A Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. It provides a good way to track teams in a work environment. It alows for quick review and contact points for teams and their members. The project allowed me to practice OOP in the node environment and dynamically create web pages using command line prompts for content.

## Installation

The app runs via the command line, using Node index.js.

## Usage

Initiate prompts to build a team by running Node index. First create the manager position, then add as many engineers and interns as needed. Once the prompts are finished, an index.html file is created that when loded in a browser will display cards for each employee with links for contact and online github profiles and other inter-office info.
